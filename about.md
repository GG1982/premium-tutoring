biography: |
  I started tutoring because I saw a recurring problem in the classroom: **talented students were failing because of confidence, not ability.**
  
  Schools move fast. If a student misses one concept in Year 9, it creates a gap that widens by Year 11. My method is about finding that gap, fixing it, and then pushing beyond the curriculum.
  
  I don't just teach students how to pass an exam; I teach them how to think like mathematicians. This skill serves them well beyond their GCSEs and A-Levels, helping them secure places at top universities like LSE, Imperial, and Oxbridge.
