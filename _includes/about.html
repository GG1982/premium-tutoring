        <h2>More than just a maths teacher—a mentor for your child’s academic journey.</h2>
        
        <p>I understand that for many students, maths can be a source of anxiety. My approach goes beyond the syllabus. Whether we are tackling KS2 foundations or preparing for University Entrance exams, my goal is to build the resilience and problem-solving confidence that translates into higher grades.</p>
        
        <p>With a background in Mathematics and over 10 years of private tuition experience, I specialise in translating complex abstract concepts into clear, manageable steps. I provide a calm, structured environment where it is safe to make mistakes—because that is where the learning happens.</p>
