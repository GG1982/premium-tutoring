challenges:
  - "The 'Algebra Shock': Struggling with the sudden move from numbers to letters (x and y)."
  - "Falling behind in Year 7 and getting trapped in a lower set/stream."
  - "Gaps in primary knowledge (times tables, fractions) causing issues with harder topics."
  - "Loss of confidence: 'I used to be good at maths, but now I don't understand it.'"

solutions:
  - "<strong>Visual Algebra:</strong> We use visual block models to explain <em>why</em> algebra works, removing the fear of abstract letters."
  - "Set-Targeting Strategy: We specifically target the topics schools use to decide sets, giving your child the best chance of moving up."
  - "Fun & Gamification: At this age, engagement is key. We keep lessons interactive to stop 'maths anxiety' from taking root."
  - "The 'Why' Method: We don't just teach rules; we teach the logic, so they don't have to memorize endless formulas."

    quote: "I didn't get algebra at all at school. It just looked like gibberish. Now solving equations is my favourite part of the test."

faqs:
  - question: "Is Year 7 too early for tuition?"
    answer: "Not at all. Year 7 is the critical 'bridge' year. If a student falls behind here, the gap widens every year until GCSE. Fixing issues now is 10x easier than in Year 11."
  - question: "Do you help with 11+ or 13+ Common Entrance?"
    answer: "Yes. We support students preparing for entrance exams to private senior schools, covering the specific 'Level 2' and 'Level 3' papers required."
  - question: "Will this put too much pressure on them?"
    answer: "KS3 lessons are designed to be lighter and more supportive than our intense A-Level courses. The aim is to make school maths feel *easier*, reducing their overall stress."
  - question: "How does this help with GCSEs?"
    answer: "GCSE Maths is a 5-year journey. By mastering the foundations (Algebra, Ratio, Fractions) in KS3, the GCSE years become about refinement rather than struggle."
