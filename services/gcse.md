faqs:
  - question: "Should my child do Higher or Foundation?"
    answer: "This is a strategic decision. Foundation is capped at Grade 5. If your child is currently working at a Grade 4/5, we often recommend securing a strong Foundation pass rather than risking a low grade on Higher. We can assess this for you."
  - question: "Do you cover IGCSE?"
    answer: "Yes. Many private schools sit the Edexcel or Cambridge IGCSE. We are fully familiar with the slight differences in syllabus (e.g., differentiation is included in IGCSE)."
  - question: "My child has lost all confidence. Can you help?"
    answer: "Confidence is our primary metric. We start with topics they are comfortable with to build a 'winning streak' before tackling the harder concepts. The change in attitude is usually immediate."
  - question: "How many sessions a week do we need?"
    answer: "For most GCSE students, 1 hour per week is sufficient if they also use our Portal for homework. In the final term before exams, many increase to 2 hours."
