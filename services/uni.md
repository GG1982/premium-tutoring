title: University Entrance
subtitle: "Elite preparation for STEP, MAT, TMUA, and AEA to secure places at Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, and Warwick."

permalink: /services/uni

challenges:
  - "Finding that A-Level Maths knowledge is not enough to solve admission problems."
  - "Struggling with the non-standard, open-ended nature of STEP/MAT questions."
  - "Running out of time due to the intense pressure of the paper."
  - "Anxiety about the 'Grade 1' or 'Distinction' requirement for your offer."

solutions:
  - "<strong>Problem-Solving Toolbox:</strong> We teach you specific heuristics to attack problems when you have no idea where to start."
  - "Olympiad-Style Training: Moving beyond 'methods' to deep logical reasoning and proof construction."
  - "Past Paper Deconstruction: We don't just solve papers; we dissect the examiner's logic so you can predict the next step."
  - "Mock Interview Prep: Many of these questions are discussed in interviews. We train you to vocalise your mathematical thinking."

# Specific Exams Covered
exam_boards:
  - "STEP II & III"

    icon: "bi-puzzle"
    text: "In these exams, getting stuck is normal. We teach you a mental protocol to unstick yourself using small cases, simplification, and working backwards."
  - title: "Rigorous Marking"
    icon: "bi-pen"
    text: "STEP requires perfect written communication. We mark your work exactly as a Cambridge examiner would, penalising poor notation or gaps in logic."
  - title: "Timed Conditions"
    icon: "bi-stopwatch"
    text: "Speed is the enemy. We practice time-management strategies to ensure you pick the questions that yield the highest marks in the shortest time."

student_reviews:
  - name: "James"
    sub: "Accepted to Cambridge (Maths)"
    quote: "I thought I was good at maths until I saw a STEP paper. Giuliano taught me how to actually 'think' rather than just follow a method. I got my Grade 1."

  - name: "Priya"
    sub: "Accepted to Oxford (CS)"
    quote: "The MAT preparation was intense but vital. We went through every trick the examiners use. I walked into the exam hall feeling genuinely ready."

faqs:
  - question: "When should we start preparing?"
    answer: "Ideally, Year 12. STEP and MAT require a different way of thinking that takes 6-12 months to develop. Cramming a few weeks before the exam rarely works."
  - question: "Do you help with the Personal Statement?"
    answer: "Yes. We can guide you on which mathematical books to read and how to discuss them in your statement to demonstrate genuine passion to admissions tutors."
  - question: "What is the difference between STEP and MAT?"
    answer: "MAT (Oxford) is taken in October/November and tests aptitude/speed. STEP (Cambridge) is taken in June (end of Year 13) and tests deep mathematical stamina and technical ability."
  - question: "My school doesn't offer STEP support. Can you help?"
    answer: "This is very common. Most schools do not have the resources to teach to this level. We provide the full curriculum support you would get at a top private school."
