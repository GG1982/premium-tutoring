faqs:
  - question: "When should we start SATs preparation?"
    answer: "Ideally in Year 5. This allows us to cover the syllabus gently and fix foundation gaps (like times tables) without the 'cramming' panic in Year 6."
  - question: "My child gets bored easily. How do you keep them engaged?"
    answer: "Our KS2 sessions are shorter-paced, gamified, and interactive. We switch topics frequently and use screen-sharing tools to let the student 'write' on the board."
  - question: "What is 'Greater Depth'?"
    answer: "This is the highest standard in SATs. We push able students beyond the basics, teaching them how to apply maths to complex, multi-step problems."
  - question: "Do you cover homework help?"
    answer: "Yes. If they are stuck on school homework, we can use the start of the lesson to clear up confusion so they don't fall behind in class."
