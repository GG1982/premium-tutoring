permalink: /services/ks2-maths/

challenges:
  - "The 'Word Problem' Wall: Students who can do sums but freeze when asked a written question."
  - "11+ Pressure: The anxiety of entrance exams for Grammar or Private schools."
  - "Slow mental maths (e.g., struggling with times tables) holding them back."
  - "Boredom in class leading to a belief that 'maths is dull/hard'."

solutions:
  - "<strong>Gamified Learning:</strong> We turn drills into challenges. If they enjoy the lesson, they retain the information."
  - "11+ Non-Verbal Logic: We teach the specific pattern-spotting skills required for GL and CEM assessments."
  - "Visualising Fractions: Using pizza slices, bars, and blocks to make abstract concepts like '3/4 of 20' obvious."
  - "Word Problem Translation: Teaching kids how to highlight keywords and translate English sentences into maths sums."

    text: "We don't just write numbers. We draw diagrams and use physical examples. Once they 'see' the maths, the method sticks forever."

faqs:
  - question: "When should we start 11+ preparation?"
    answer: "We recommend starting in Year 4 or very early Year 5. This allows us to cover the syllabus gently without the 'cramming' panic that causes stress."
  - question: "Do you teach Non-Verbal Reasoning?"
    answer: "Yes. NVR is a huge part of the 11+ (GL and CEM). We teach specific techniques to rotate shapes and spot patterns in your head."
  - question: "My child gets bored easily. How do you keep them engaged?"
    answer: "Our KS2 sessions are shorter-paced and interactive. We switch topics frequently and use screen-sharing tools to let the student 'write' on the board."
  - question: "Do you help with SATs?"
    answer: "Yes. While many parents focus on the 11+, we also ensure students are ready for their Year 6 SATs, ensuring they leave primary school with a 'High Standard' score."
